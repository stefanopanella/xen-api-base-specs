%description

Bisect-summary reads bisect*.out files produced by code that was
instrumented with bisect_ppx for code coverage profiling. Unlike
bisect-ppx-report (the canonical tool), this tool only needs the files
produced at runtime and doesn't require access to the source code and
point files that bisect_ppx produces at compile time.
